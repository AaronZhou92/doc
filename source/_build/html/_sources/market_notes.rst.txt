American's appeal:

1.2 Concepts
---------------------
**QE trade**
    Long US stocks, dollar, core European government bonds

**Yield Curve Invert**
    Yields on short term Treasuries rise above returns on long term dated debt, typically 2 yr and 10 yr Treasury

    Contributions to economy slowdow:

    - Banks borrow monery in short term and lend them in long term to earn profit
    - In case of inverted rates, bank profits get squeezed and they will cut back on lending
    - Thus put brake on economic activity
    - **Thus, an inverted yield curve might do more than predict a recession: It might actually cause one**
